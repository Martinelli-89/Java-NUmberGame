# Java-NUmberGame
<h2>Java Number Game</h2>
<br>
<p>This is a simple game to put in practice our understanding of Java.</p>
<br>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The program generate a number between 1 and 100;</li>
  <li>the user has 10 chances to guess the number;</li>
  <li>if the user already entered a number the programm will let him know and won't add it to the total number of guesses;</li>
  <li>The program ends if the user used 10 guesses;</li>
  <li>If the user guess the number correctly the programm will display it and confirm the number of guesses used;</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bugs</h4>
<p>Currently the programm break if the user enter  something that it isn't an integer. I could not fix the problem because I kept getting stuck in an infinite loop with the try catch to validate the input. </p>
